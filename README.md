# BlackJackProject

# Description
This program simulates a game of BlackJack with the user taking on the dealer to see who can get BlackJack.

# Technologies used
Java, Eclipse

# Lessons learned
Learned how to implement a lot of the material that has been presented over the last few weeks including for loops, if statements, arrayLists, abstract classes, parent/child classes, Method calling/using Methods to keep code DRY in order to make this project function correctly. Working on the things I felt confident in was really helpful in not getting to overwhelmed by the things I wasn't so confident in. It was really rewarding to have this project come together and see all the moving pieces work together in seamless way and I'm looking forward to what ill be working on next.
